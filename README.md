# Important Info Before Installation:
As of new changes the installation logic has changed dated: `11/22/2023` for seamless installation across KSU/Magisk/Newer android versions. With no font or font related module (that modifies `fonts.xml`) installed (if installed any uninstall all of them and reboot) open any Terminal app eg. `Termux` run this following command with root permission. 
```
su -c '
rm -rf /sdcard/MFFM/fontsxml
[ ! -d /sdcard/MFFM/fontsxml ] && mkdir -p /sdcard/MFFM/fontsxml
cp /system/etc/fonts.xml /sdcard/MFFM/fontsxml/fonts.xml
cp /product/etc/fonts_customization.xml /sdcard/MFFM/fontsxml/fonts_customization.xml'
```
You only need to do this once. Repeat this only if you change ROM! After this you are ready to install, update, dirty install, install `MFFMv12` modules without any trouble. 

# Usages:
You can use the template as an installer or as a regular Magisk module template, or both at the same time. 
To use it as a module template you can copy the renamed files directly to the template's `Files` folder to make a permanent module.

To use the template as an installer first you have to create a folder named `MFFM` in your local storage. Then you can copy your `renamed files` to the `MFFM` & `MFFM/fonts` folder. Other detailed instructions are in particular sections of the respective topis (Which file/script goes where).

Remember you can use both mode `(Template/Installer)` at the same, so it really doesn't matter where ever `(inside the template or in the MFFM foler)` you put your files. The template should work just fine.

If same category files `(eg. Bengali Fonts)` are present in both the `MFFM` folder and inside of the module `(in Files folder)`, the module's content will be flashed and `MFFM` folder's content will be ignored. 

## Latin/English Fonts
- Download the template from [Releases](https://github.com/mistu2020/mffm_v11_public/tree/main/Releases) folder.
- The best way is to use the template is to use it with `MT Manager` file manager.  With [MT Manager](https://m.apkpure.com/mt-manager/bin.mt.plus) you can directly edit the zip file without unpacking it.
- Eitherway you can unpack the zip file with any file manager, I recommend Mixplorer. And after editing/copying files in the template, repack the template content to `.zip` archive to make a module.
- You are going to need 12 font style to use this template. Rename your font file as stated bellow:
    ```
    Black.ttf
    BlackItalic.ttf
    Bold.ttf
    BoldItalic.ttf
    Medium.ttf
    MediumItalic.ttf
    Regular.ttf
    Italic.ttf
    Light.ttf
    LightItalic.ttf
    Thin.ttf
    ThinItalic.ttf
    ```
- And then copy those font files to `Files` folder of the template to make a module. 
- If you have only one font file or want to use only one weight/style then rename the file to `MFFM.ttf` and copy it to `Files` folder of the template.
- If you want to use in installer mode, create a folder named `Fonts` inside `MFFM` folder. Put the renamed files in the `MFFM/Fonts` folder. Flash the template/Installer

# Optional Usage
- Even though the following tutorial follows the `installer` mode, you can shove the `renamed files` directly to the Template's `Files` folder to use it as a permanent module.

## Bengali Fonts
 - You are gonna need 3 styles/weights of your Bengali font, Bold/Medium/Regular. If you have only one weight (ie. Regular), copy it and make total 3 copies.
 - Rename the 3 weight (Bold/Medium/Regular) Bengali font like this:
```
Beng-Regular.ttf  
Beng-Medium.ttf  
Beng-Bold.ttf
 ```
- Then you can directly copy the font files to `MFFM Folder (/LocalStorage/MFFM)` or make a zip archive directly `(without putting them in a folder)` and rename it to `Beng-FontName.zip` and then copy it to `MFFM` folder to avoid messy environment inside the `MFFM` folder. Eg: `Beng-Kalpurush.zip`
 
## Emoji
 - Add `Emoji-` before the name of your Emoji font and put it in the `MFFM` folder. EG: rename `WhatsappEmoji.ttf`  to `Emoji-WhatsappEmoji.ttf`
 - Download the Emoji Addon from [here](https://github.com/charityrolfson433/mffmv11/tree/main/Emoji%20Fonts%20Packges). Put it inside the `MFFM Folder (/LocalStorage/MFFM)` folder alongside the renamed emoji file.
## Monospace
-  To use any `Monospace` font, add  `Mono-` before the name of your font and put it in `MFFM` folder.  EG: rename `Firacode-Regular.ttf` to `Mono-Firacode-Regular.ttf`
## Serif
- To use Serif font, you will need 4 styles. Regular, Italic, Bold and BoldItalic. Rename your fonts like this:
```
Serif-Regular.ttf
Serif-Italic.ttf
Serif-Bold.ttf
Serif-BoldItalic.ttf
```
- After renaming, either copy them direct to `MFFM` folder or make a `zip archive` following this naming pattern, '`Serif-YourFontName.zip`' eg `Serif-SourceSerif.zip` and as usual copy the archive to `MFFM` folder.
- Lastly, however you place your files in `MFFM` folder, if the naming patterns are followed it will be installed once you flash your original font module. 
# Magisk Hide / Zygisk Denylist Hidden App Crash
- **With the latest changes modules can be used without any major issue, yet if you find any issues, report in the group.**

# GApps Font
- If your mffm template powered modules stopped working in Google Apps or didn't change at all, you can run this commands for respective (11 or 12 template) templates in Terminal with Super User privileges. No need to restart, Force close any Google App if not still showing the font. 
```
for mffm11 su -c /data/adb/modules/mffm11/service.sh
for mffm12 su -c /data/adb/modules/mffmv12/service.sh 
```
if method mentioned above is not working for you then flash [KillGMSFont](https://github.com/MrCarb0n/killgmsfont) Magisk Module by [MrCarb0n](https://github.com/MrCarb0n/)
